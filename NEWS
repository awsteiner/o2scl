Notes for 0.927 release:

The internal structure has been reworked so that the HDF5, EOS, and
particle libraries are always included and there is only one library
file, libo2scl.

Constants, unit conversions, the find_constants class, and the
associated documentation have been improved.

The boost integration and multiprecision libraries are now enabled by
default. The precision parameter in the dtos() function has been updated
to automatically output either digits or max_digits as requested by
the user. Multiprecision support has been improved throughout.

The old cubature classes have been removed but there is still a
./configure flag for cubature support (principally for the separate
EOS code which is under development).

Classes funct_python, fermion_rel, polylog, eos_quark_njl, nstar_cold,
eos_had_rmf_hyp, multi_funct_python, mm_funct_python, interp_krige,
interpm_krige, inte_qagi_gsl, inte_adapt_cern, eos_had_base,
bessel_K_exp_integ_boost, nucmass_dz, calc_utf8, convert_units,

Class eos_cs2_const was removed since its functionality is in
contained in eos_tov_linear.

New classes eos_leptons, emulator, emulator_python,
emulator_interpm_idw_table, fermi_dirac_integ_bf, part_funcs, and
eos_quark_njl_vec have been created.

The strings_spec function has been updated. New function unc_to_string()
has been added.

The ex_eos_gibbs and ex_lambda examples have been updated.

improved. The python interface is much more detailed and there has
been corresponding work on the examples in o2sclpy.

The Doxygen XML and run-time acol documentation has been synchronized
so that acol documentation will be clearer and more easily updated.
A corresponding new "vec_vec_string" type has been added to acol
and hdf_file. New command 'ninteg' was added to acol.

has caused some problems with o2graph.

A new version of the calculator class which partially supports UTF8 is
in implemented in calc_utf8. This new UTF-8 compatible class is used
in O2scl unless O2SCL_NO_CALC_UTF8 is defined. There are still some

Template types in the ODE classes have been updated to allow
more flexbility. C++11 support is also better for the ODE classes.

A function hist::normalize() has been added.

Boost-related solvers and minimizers have been added. 

Linear fitting in fit_linear has been updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.913 release:

All of the O2scl vector and matrix classes have been deprecated. O2scl
now requires Boost, and works with the Boost vector and matrix types.

Notes for 0.911 release:

O2scl has been updated to compile gracefully with newer versions of gcc. 

Most of the 1-dimensional function objects have been converted to
be const where appropriate. 

The interpolation classes have been reworked. Interpolation managers
have been replaced with an integer interpolation type. 

In several places functions which return 'int' now return 'void', bringing
O2scl more in line with C++ error-handling rather than GSL-like integer
return values. 

The contour and two-dimensional interpolation classes have been updated
in several places. 

The experimental expectation value classes have been improved.

on rmf_eos has been added, rmf_nucleus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.908 release:

The GSL integration routines have been reworked, in large part due to
the efforts of Jerry Gagelman. The GSL integration workspace is now a
separate class and the QAWS integration now works. The documentation
has been improved considerably. Error handling and verbose reporting
has been improved. Testing is also much more complete.

A couple C++ language issues were fixed to assist compilation with
newer compilers and a few small updates to gsl_chebapp and
gsl_mmin_conf were made corresponding to the GSL-1.15 update.

The documentation of the ODE classes was improved. 

Bugs were fixed in umatrix_tlate::set_all() and hdf_nucmass_io. 

The TOV solver classes have been updated in several places. 

The command-line interface class, cli, has been updated, along with
the acol command-line utility in o2scl_ext. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.907 release:

The most significant change for this release is that the old I/O
classes are being deprecated in favor of a new I/O system
utilizing HDF files. This means that version 0.907 is likely
the last version of O2scl which will support I/O using the old
classes. In the case of the o2scl_ext additional library, the 
command-line utility 'acol' now manipulates HDF files. 

The temporary command-line utility 'acol_old' performs input of data
tables using the old I/O format and outputs HDF files. Thus 'acol_old'
can be used to convert data files from the old to the new format. I
don't expect this to be a significant issue for a large number of
users, but please post to the o2scl-help mailing list if you have
difficulty.

The sole drawback of HDF file I/O is that users will now either
have to specify the location of the HDF library on their system
or give the configure script the option '--disable-hdf'. The new
I/O system using HDF files is much easier to use than the old I/O
classes. All of the native O2scl data files have been updated to 
the new HDF format. 

The o2scl-test makefile targets have been upgraded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.906 release:

The table histogram functions have been updated, though these will
eventually be replaced by a new histogram data type. 

Some new statistics functions have been added to smart_interp.h,
and some of the functions in vec_stats.h have been improved.

The nuclear mass data from the Atomic Mass Evaluation has been
updated.

The fermion classes have been updated and a new calibration function
has been added to the fermion_T class. 

The IML linear solvers have been updated, and a new example
demonstrating their use, 'ex_it_iml' has been added to the O2scl_ext
package.

The source code to plot the output of the examples has been moved to
a new directory 'examples/plot'. 

A chi-squared test has been added.

A new Markov chain example has been added.

The documentation has been improved in several places and exception
messages have been modified to be more informative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.905 release:

O2scl now uses C++ exceptions for error handling. By default O2scl and
GSL errors will now throw C++ exceptions. GSL errors are mapped to C++
exception objects. This default behavior can be easily modified.

The ODE routines have all been updated to include error information
and perform more efficiently, and a stiff integrator gsl_bsimp has
been added along with an example ex_stiff. A new example ex_ode_it
has also been added. 

Several vector functions have been added in vector.h and some of 
the currently existing functions were reworked. 

The binary search functions have been moved to vector.h and there have
been some changes to the search_vec class. Documentation in both cases
was improved significantly.

The statistics functions in vec_stats.h were updated.

Some template types have been added to the linalg functions to 
make them more generic. 

The gsl_miser and gsl_vegas classes have been updated, and there
were some small changes in the other GSL integrators. 

The annealing classes have been updated. 

A gsl_smooth class has been added which employs the GSL basis spline
functions to smooth data. 

There were a couple of fixes to table and table_units.

A few updates have been made to the nuclear mass fitting class,
mass_fit, and a class arb_dist was added for an arbitrary 
nuclear distribution.

New example ex_mandel was added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.904 release:

Created new classes convert_units and table_units to facilitate unit
conversion. The tests have been reworked so that they no longer
require the user to have grep, awk, and tail. There were a couple
fixes to ensure compatibility with the Intel compiler. Several other
documentation updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.903 release:

There is no version 0.903 in order to make the version matching
with o2scl_ext more clear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.902 release:

Reworked the vector and matrix classes to solve const-correctness
issues. Reworked gsl_anneal class to allow more flexibility in
changing the algorithm.

Added classes anneal_mt (threaded version of gsl_anneal), format_float
(which replaces the old double_to_latex() and double_to_html()
functions), gsl_rkf45, nonrel_fermion_zerot, hadronic_eos_temp (to
clearly separate the zero and finite temperature parts of
hadronic_eos), and nse_eos. Added several Skyrme parameterizations.

Fixed bugs in hh_base and qr_base found in the gsl-1.12 update. Added
gsl_mmin_simp2, corresponding to the gsl-1.12 simplex2 minimizer. 

Several documentation updates and minor bug fixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.901 release:

The function pointer classes didn't allow the user to specify const
member functions so that flexibility has been added with classes
named with 'cmfptr' rather than 'mfptr'. 

A ODE multiple shooting class (from Julien Garaud) and a unit
conversion class have been added. The gsl_chebapp class was updated. 
Some classes have been added associated with nuclear reactions.
A implicit ODE stepper was added based on the GSL 'bsimp' stepper.

There are also several other small fixes in nonrel_fermion, rmf_eos,
the QR routines, skyrme_eos, schematic_eos, and the ovector classes.

There are also several documentation updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.9 release:

This is the first beta release of O2scl. The majority of the classes
are stable enough for general use. The full library, all of the tests,
and all of the examples should compile on most systems. Generally,
the library testing should also succeed without failure.

There are still some classes and functions which are experimental. The
decision to release a beta version while some of the classes are still
in development was intentional: it allows users to use the more
experimental classes and see what may be possible with O2scl in the 
future, hopefully without causing too many difficulties in testing and
compilaion for the casual end-user. 

Since version 0.805, several changes have been made:

There have been extensive documentation updates, and all experimental
classes are explicitly indicated as such, so that users are properly
warned.

The gsl_min_brent class has been fixed. The composite integration 
classes composite_inte and comp_gen_inte have been updated. The
class search_vec was fixed. 

Most of the unnecessary void *'s have been removed.

Error handling has been reworked slightly, so that the user has more
control over when an error is called. The default error handler now
aborts execution if the error handler is called. 

Some problems with executable file name suffixes in Cygwin have 
been fixed.

Self-assignment is now properly handled in ovector and related classes.

The o2scl_arith namespace was removed, as it caused problems
with Koenig lookup.

A new table3d class was created -- a 3-dimensional version of the 
table class. 

The contour and twod_intp classes were been updated.

Interpolation managers were created, to make memory management simpler.

The linear solvers have been reworked slightly,
especially so that they will work better with the O2scl_ext package.
An error in the linalg makefile was also fixed. The basic matrix-matrix
multiply function was also fixed.

Some of the particle and EOS classes have been reworked slightly,
and the old CFL EOSs have been removed, There were small changes
in skyrme_eos, hadronic_eos, eff_boson, nonrel_femrion, and eff_fermion.

Some major work has been performed on the collection class, but this
and related classes are still experimental.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.806 release:

Version 0.806 was a quick release to fix some compilation difficulties
on Mac OS X. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.805 release:

There are several new examples and new associated documentation. The
examples are still a work in progress, but hopefully this will make
the library more transparent.

There are several fixes to ensure classes are purely virtual when they
should be.

A few of the vector functions have been moved around slightly, 
and the documentation for vectors and matrices has been improved 
significantly. 

Finally, the linear algebra functions now have their own namespace
and offer operator[] and operator() versions. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.804 release:

The test targets have been reimplemented so that they are automake
targets and use libtool. This should make them a little more portable
and easier to use.

A small set of linear algebra routines has been added, which provides
for LU, QR, householder, and tridiagonal solvers for generic vector
and matrix types. Also, a << operator has been defined for the
permutation class.

Several classes have been updated and or fixed, including eff_fermion,
rel_boson, eff_boson, cern_adapt, and cern_gauss56, ode_iv_solve,
tov_eos and tov_solve.  The GSL solver class gsl_mroot_hybrids has
been updated to be faster and is now properly generalized to generic
vector and matrix types.

Also, the documentation has been improved and updated in several places.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.803 release:

A permutation class, which is fully compatible with gsl_permutation
objects (ovector and omatrix are also compatible with gsl_vector and
gsl_matrix). The functions which apply a permutation to a user-specified
vector are member template functions in the permutation class. 

New classes based on the Open Optimization Library (OOL) (available
from http://ool.sourceforge.net) which perfom constrained minimization
have been added. At present, only the projected gradient and spectral
projected gradient methods are implemented, and the "gencan" method is
in progress. These minimizers work consistently with the other
multidimensional minimizers in O2scl and are now sufficiently flexible
to accept member functions as arguments, but are still essentially
identical to the original versions. 

The class gsl_miser has been updated to be compatibile with generic
vector types. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for 0.802 release:

The classes gsl_monte, gsl_vegas, and gsl_anneal have all been
updated. They are now compatible with any sufficiently constructed
vector type. In the case of class gsl_vegas, the interface has been
significantly updated so that the user should have a lot more freedom
(even more freedom than in the original GSL) to use or modify the
integration algorithm as desired.

There were a couple bugs in gsl_rkck, gsl_rk8pd, and the interpolation
in the new tensor class which have been fixed. The ODE classes now
properly allow one to choose the same objects for y and yout or
the same objects for dydx and dydx_out, which should be easier for 
more "casual" users. 

Statistics functions (mean, standard deviation, autocorrelation, etc)
have been added and are defined in vec_stats.h for generic double 
vector types. 

The range checking is (at present) performed with "#if
O2SCL_NO_RANGE_CHECK...#endif" blocks. This is similar to how GSL used
to do range checking in earlier versions. There is now a function in
the class lib_settings_class which checks to see if range checking was
turned on at the library compile time.
