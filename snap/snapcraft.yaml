  summary: Object-oriented Scientific Computing Library
  description: |
    O2scl is a C++ library for object-oriented numerical programming. 
    It includes interpolation, differentiation, integration, roots of 
    polynomials, equation solving, minimization, constrained 
    minimization, Monte Carlo integration, simulated annealing, 
    least-squares fitting, solution of ordinary differential equations, 
    two-dimensional interpolation, Chebyshev approximation, 
    unit conversions, and file I/O with HDF5.

  grade: devel
  confinement: devmode
  base: core20

# 4/29/19: I used to include -libc6 in stage-packages but it doesn't
# appear to be needed any more

# 11/6/19: Trying an rpath build to simplify the use of acol on snap
# installations. The older compiler flag is needed because 16.04 LTS
# doesn't have the newer boost integration libraries. The rpath flag
# doesn't seem to do anything at the moment.

# 3/12/2020: Added O2SCL_HDF5_PRE_1_12 for old HDF5 interface

# 1/6/2021: Removing the rpath stuff for now. Added base keyword above
# and reconfigured. Added apps section (I'm not sure if the apps
# section will work or is useful outside of strict confinement). I had
# to manually add the hdf5 and compression libraries to LIBS.
