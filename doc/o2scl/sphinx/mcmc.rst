Probability distributions
-------------------------

Probability distributions are provided by the C++ standard library,
but some useful functionality is not included and multidimensional and
conditional distributions are not provided. For the time being, some
experimental probability distributions are included in O₂scl.

The one-dimensional probability distributions are children of
:ref:`prob_dens_func <prob_dens_func>` and are modeled similar to the
C++ standard distributions:

- :ref:`prob_dens_gaussian <prob_dens_gaussian>`
- :ref:`prob_dens_lognormal <prob_dens_lognormal>`
- :ref:`prob_dens_uniform <prob_dens_uniform>`
- :ref:`prob_dens_hist <prob_dens_hist>`

Multi-dimensional distributions are children of :ref:`prob_dens_mdim
<prob_dens_mdim>`, including

- :ref:`prob_dens_mdim_factor <prob_dens_mdim_factor>`
- :ref:`prob_dens_mdim_gaussian <prob_dens_mdim_gaussian>`
- :ref:`prob_dens_mdim_biv_gaussian <prob_dens_mdim_biv_gaussian>`
- :ref:`prob_dens_mdim_amr <prob_dens_mdim_amr>`

Conditional probability distributions are children of 
:ref:`prob_cond_mdim <prob_cond_mdim>`. These classes can be used
as proposal distributions for the O₂scl MCMC classes.

- :ref:`prob_cond_mdim_gaussian <prob_cond_mdim_gaussian>`
- :ref:`prob_cond_mdim_fixed_step <prob_cond_mdim_fixed_step>`
- :ref:`prob_cond_mdim_indep <prob_cond_mdim_indep>`


Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
-------------------------------

The class :ref:`mcmc_para_base <mcmc_para_base>` performs generic MCMC
simulations and the child class :ref:`mcmc_para_table
<mcmc_para_table>` performs MCMC simulations and stores the results in
a :ref:`table_units <table_units>` object. These classes contain
support for OpenMP and MPI (or both). The class :ref:`mcmc_para_cli
<mcmc_para_cli>` is a specialized class which automatically handles
the command-line interface when using MCMC.
