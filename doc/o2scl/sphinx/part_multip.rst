Multiprecision Support
======================

:ref:`O2scl_part <o2sclp>`

Multiprecision support for :ref:`O2scl_part <o2sclp>` classes is in
progress. In the future, classes with a ``_tl`` suffix are compatible
with a range of floating-point types. Support for types beyond
``double`` is still experimental.
