:sub:`2`\ sclpy, which assists in manipulating and plotting HDF5 files
generated by O₂scl. It is separately documented at
https://neutronstars.utk.edu/code/o2sclpy . O₂sclpy's
version numbers which loosely follow the main library releases. The
release version of the python package can be installed with, e.g.
