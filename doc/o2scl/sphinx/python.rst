:ref:`O2scl <o2scl>`

O₂scl has an associated experimental python package, O\
:sub:`2`\ sclpy, which assists in manipulating and plotting HDF5 files
generated by O₂scl. It is separately documented at
https://neutronstars.utk.edu/code/o2sclpy . O₂sclpy's
version numbers which loosely follow the main library releases. The
release version of the python package can be installed with, e.g.
``pip3 install o2sclpy`` or obtained from
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/o2sclpy , and the development version can
be obtained from https://github.com/awsteiner/o2sclpy .

There are several global functions with extern "C" linkage used to
communicate between python and the
:cpp:class:`o2scl_acol::acol_manager` class defined in acolm.h. If
python support is enabled when installing O₂scl, then there are
classes which provide a C++ interface to Python classes in O₂sclpy,
including :ref:`interpm_python <interpm_python>`, :ref:`gmm_python
<gmm_python>`, and :ref:`kde_python <kde_python>`.
