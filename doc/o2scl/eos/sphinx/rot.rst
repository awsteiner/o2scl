Rotating Neutron Stars
======================

The class :ref:`nstar_rot <nstar_rot>` solves for the structure of a
rotating neutron star given an equation of state. This C++ code was
based on the RNS code developed by N. Stergioulas and
S. Morsink. This current class is functional, but 
somewhat experimental and not yet well-documented.
