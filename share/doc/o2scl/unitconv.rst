Unit Conversions
================

:ref:`O2scl <o2scl>`

There is a class which performs conversion between units specified
with strings in :ref:`convert_units <convert_units>`. Most commonly
used units and multiples thereof are easily processed by this class.
Unit conversions are cached so that future requests of the same
conversion factor are faster.
