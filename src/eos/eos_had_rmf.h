  /** \brief Relativistic mean field theory EOS

      This class computes the properties of nucleonic matter using a
      mean-field approximation to a field-theoretical model.
      
      Before sending neutrons and protons to these member functions,
      the masses should be set to and the degeneracy factor should be
      set to 2. Some models which can be loaded using
      <tt>o2scl_hdf::rmf_load()</tt> expect that the neutron and
      proton masses are set to the value stored in \ref mnuc.
    
      \note Since this EOS uses the effective masses and chemical
      potentials in the \ref o2scl::part class, the values of
      <tt>o2scl::part::non_interacting</tt> for neutrons and protons
      are set to false in many of the functions.

      \note Matter at two different densities can have the same
      chemical potentials, so the behavior of the function \ref
      o2scl::eos_had_rmf::calc_temp_p() is ambiguous. This arises
      because the field equations have more than one solution for a
      specified chemical potential. Internally, \ref
      o2scl::eos_had_rmf::calc_temp_p() either uses the initial guess
      specified by a call to \ref o2scl::eos_had_rmf::set_fields(), or
      uses hard-coded initial guess values typical for saturation
      densities. In order to ensure that the user gets the desired
      solution to the field equations, it may be necessary to specify
      a sufficiently accurate initial guess. There is no ambiguity in
      the behavior of \ref o2scl::eos_had_rmf::calc_eq_temp_p(),
      however.

      \note This class can fail to solve the meson field equations or
      fail to solve for the nucleon densities. By default the error
      handler is called when this happens. If \ref
      eos_had_base::err_nonconv is false, then functions which don't
      converge (which also return <tt>int</tt>) will return a non-zero
      value. Note that the solvers (in \ref def_sat_mroot and \ref
      o2scl::eos_had_base::def_mroot) also has its own data member
      indicating how to handle nonconvergence \ref
      o2scl::mroot::err_nonconv which is separate.

      \comment
      AWS, 11/17/13: It is not clear that this is entirely necessary
      as almost all the CONV_ERR calls in eos_had_rmf.cpp are due to calls
      to solvers. It could be that then err_nonconv can be removed and
      all the eos_had_rmf functions just always directly return any
      nonzero values they get from solvers. One nice thing about the
      explicit CONV_ERR calls in eos_had_rmf.cpp is that it makes the code
      easier to read. In any case err_nonconv should probably be
      pushed up to eos_had_base.
      AWS: 6/14/17: Moved err_nonconv up to eos_had_base now because
      I need it in eos_had_skyrme and it's needed in eos_had_eden_base
      anyway, so it might as well be in the parent.

      \b Background

      The full Lagragian can be written as a sum of several terms
      \f[
      {\cal L} = {\cal L}_{\mathrm{Dirac}} + {\cal L}_{\sigma} + 
      {\cal L}_{\omega} + {\cal L}_{\rho} + {\cal L}_{\mathrm{int}} \, .
      \f]

      The part for the nucleon fields is
      \f[
      {\cal L}_{\mathrm{Dirac}} = 
      \bar{\Psi}_i \left[ i {{\partial}\!\!\!{\backslash}} - 
      g_{\omega} {{\omega}\!\!\!{\backslash}} - \frac{g_{\rho}}{2} 
      {{\vec{\rho}}\!\!\!{\backslash}}
      \vec{\tau} - M_i + g_{\sigma} \sigma - 
      e q_i A\!\!\!{\backslash} \right] \Psi_i 
      \f]
      where \f$ \Psi \f$ is the nucleon field and \f$ \sigma, \omega
      \f$ and \f$ \rho \f$ are the meson fields. The meson masses
      are \f$ m_{\sigma}, m_{\omega} \f$ and \f$ m_{\rho}
      \f$ and meson-nucleon
      couplings are \f$ g_{\sigma}, g_{\omega} \f$ and \f$ g_{\rho}
      \f$ . The couplings \c cs, \c cw, and \c cr are related to \f$
      g_{\sigma}, g_{\omega} \f$ and \f$ g_{\rho} \f$ by
      \f[
      c_{\sigma} = g_{\sigma}/m_{\sigma} \quad
      c_{\omega} = g_{\omega}/m_{\omega} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad
      c_{\rho} = g_{\rho}/m_{\rho}
      \f]
      The nucleon masses are in \f$ M_i \f$ and stored in
      <tt>part::m</tt> and \f$ q_i \f$ just represents the charge (1
      for protons and 0 for neutrons). The Coulomb field, \f$ A_{\mu}
      \f$, is ignored in this class, but used in \ref
      o2scl::nucleus_rmf.

      The part for the \f$ \sigma \f$ field is
      \f[
      {\cal L}_{\sigma} =
      {\textstyle \frac{1}{2}} \left( \partial_{\mu} \sigma \right)^2 
      - {\textstyle \frac{1}{2}} m^2_{\sigma} \sigma^2 
      - \frac{b M}{3} \left( g_{\sigma} \sigma\right)^3 
      - \frac{c}{4} \left( g_{\sigma} \sigma\right)^4 \, .
      \f]
      where \f$ m_{\sigma} \f$ is the meson mass, 
      \f$ b \f$ and \f$ c \f$ are unitless couplings and
      \f$ M \f$ is a dimensionful scale, ususally taken to be
      939 MeV (which need not be equal to \f$ M_i \f$ above). 
      The coefficients \f$ b \f$ and \f$ c \f$ are related to the somewhat
      standard \f$ \kappa \f$ and \f$ \lambda \f$ by:
      \f[
      \kappa=2 M b \quad \lambda=6 c;
      \f]

      The part for the \f$ \omega \f$ field is
      \f[
      {\cal L}_{\omega} =
      - {\textstyle \frac{1}{4}} f_{\mu \nu} f^{\mu \nu} 
      + {\textstyle \frac{1}{2}} m^2_{\omega}\omega^{\mu}\omega_{\mu} 
      + \frac{\zeta}{24} g_{\omega}^4 \left(\omega^\mu \omega_\mu\right)^2
      \f]
      where \f$ m_{\omega} \f$ is the meson mass.
      
      The part for the \f$ \rho \f$ field is
      \f[
      {\cal L}_{\rho} = 
      - {\textstyle \frac{1}{4}} \vec{B}_{\mu \nu} \cdot \vec{B}^{\mu \nu}
      + {\textstyle \frac{1}{2}} m^2_{\rho} \vec{\rho}^{~\mu} \cdot 
      \vec{\rho}_{~\mu} 
      + \frac{\xi}{24} g_{\rho}^4 \left(\vec{\rho}^{~\mu}\right) \cdot 
      \vec{\rho}_{~\mu} 
      \f]

      Finally, additional meson interactions are
      \f[
      {\cal L}_{\mathrm{int}} = 
      g_{\rho}^2 f (\sigma, \omega) \vec{\rho}^{~\mu} \cdot 
      \vec{\rho}_{~\mu} \nonumber \\
      \f]
      The function \f$ f \f$ is the coefficient of \f$ g_r^2 \rho^2 \f$ 
      \f$ f(\sigma,\omega) = b_1 \omega^2 + b_2 \omega^4 + b_3 \omega^6 +
      a_1 \sigma + a_2 \sigma^2 + a_3 \sigma^3 + a_4 \sigma^4 +
      a_5 \sigma^5 + a_6 \sigma^6 \f$ 

      \verbatim embed:rst
      where the notation from [Horowitz01]_ is:
      \endverbatim

      \f$ f(\sigma,\omega) = \lambda_4 g_s^2 \sigma^2 + 
      \lambda_v g_w^2 \omega^2 \f$ 
      This implies \f$ b_1=\lambda_v g_w^2 \f$ and 
      \f$ a_2=\lambda_4 g_s^2 \f$ 

      The couplings, \c cs, \c cw, and \c cr all have units of \f$
      \mathrm{fm} \f$, and the couplings \c b, \c c, \c zeta and \c xi are
      unitless. 

      \verbatim embed:rst
      Additional couplings are from [Steiner05b]_,
      \endverbatim

      They are: \f$ a_i \f$ have units of \f$ \mathrm{fm}^{(i-2)} \f$
      and the couplings \f$ b_j \f$ have units of \f$
      \mathrm{fm}^{(2j-2)} \f$ .

      \verbatim embed:rst
      When the variable ``zm_mode`` is true, the effective mass is
      fixed using the approach of [Zimanyi90]_.
      \endverbatim
    
      The expressions for the energy densities are often simplified in
      the literature using the field equations. These expressions are
      not used in this code since they are only applicable in infinite
      matter where the field equations hold, and are not suitable for
      use in applications (such as to finite nuclei in \ref
      o2scl::nucleus_rmf) where the spatial derivatives of the fields
      are non-zero. Notice that in the proper expressions for the
      energy density the similarity between terms in the pressure up
      to a sign. This procedure allows one to verify the thermodynamic
      identity even if the field equations are not solved and allows
      the user to add gradient terms to the energy density and
      pressure.

      \f]
      the binding energy per particle in symmetric matter at equilibrium
      is given by

      where the Dirac
      effective mass is  \f$ M^{*}_i = M_i - g_{\sigma}\sigma_0 \f$ .
      The compressibility is given by

      In the above equations, the subscipt \f$ 0 \f$ denotes the mean
      field values of \f$ \sigma \f$ and \f$ \omega \f$ .  For the case
      \f$ f=0 \f$ , the symmetry energy varies linearly with the density at
      large densities. The function \f$ f \f$ permits variations in the
      density dependence of the symmetry energy above nuclear matter
      density.

        The definition of the vector-isovector field and coupling
        matches what is done here. Compare the Lagrangian above
        with Eq. 10 from the reference.

        The following couplings should all be of the same
        size:
        \f[
        \frac{1}{2 c_s^2 M^2}, \frac{1}{2 c_v^2 M^2} 
        \frac{1}{8 c_{\rho}^2 M^2},~\mathrm{and}~\frac{
        \bar{a}_{ijk} M^{i+2 j+2 k-4}}{2^{2 k}}
        \f]
        which are equivalent to 
        \f[
        \frac{m_s^2}{2 g_s^2 M^2}, \frac{m_v^2}{2 g_v^2 M^2} 
        \frac{m_{\rho}^2}{8 g_{\rho}^2 M^2},~\mathrm{and}~\frac{
        a_{ijk} M^{i+2 j+2 k-4}}{g_s^i g_v^{2 j} 
        g_{\rho}^{2 k} 2^{2 k}}
        \f]
        
        The connection the \f$ a_{ijk} \f$ 's and the coefficients 
        that are used here is 
        \f{eqnarray*}
        \frac{b M}{3} g_{\sigma}^3 \sigma^3 &=& a_{300}~\sigma^3
        \nonumber \\
        \frac{c}{4} g_{\sigma}^4 \sigma^4 &=& a_{400}~\sigma^4
        \nonumber \\
        \frac{\zeta}{24} g_{\omega}^4 \omega^4 &=& a_{020}~\omega^4
        \nonumber \\
        \frac{\xi}{24} g_{\rho}^4 \rho^4 &=& a_{002}~\rho^4
        \nonumber \\
        b_1 g_{\rho}^2 \omega^2 \rho^2 &=& a_{011}~\omega^2 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        b_2 g_{\rho}^2 \omega^4 \rho^2 &=& a_{021}~\omega^4 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        b_3 g_{\rho}^2 \omega^6 \rho^2 &=& a_{031}~\omega^6 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        a_1 g_{\rho}^2 \sigma^1 \rho^2 &=& a_{101}~\sigma^1 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        a_2 g_{\rho}^2 \sigma^2 \rho^2 &=& a_{201}~\sigma^2 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        a_3 g_{\rho}^2 \sigma^3 \rho^2 &=& a_{301}~\sigma^3 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        a_4 g_{\rho}^2 \sigma^4 \rho^2 &=& a_{401}~\sigma^4 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        a_5 g_{\rho}^2 \sigma^5 \rho^2 &=& a_{501}~\sigma^5 \rho^2 
        \nonumber \\
        a_6 g_{\rho}^2 \sigma^6 \rho^2 &=& a_{601}~\sigma^6 \rho^2 
        \nonumber
        \f}

        Note that Muller and Serot use the notation 
        \f[
        \frac{\bar{\kappa} g_s^3 }{2} = \frac{\kappa}{2} = b M 
        g_s^3 \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad
        \frac{\bar{\lambda} g_s^4}{6} = \frac{\lambda}{6}
        = c g_s^4
        \f]
        which differs slightly from the "standard" notation above.

        We need to compare the values of
        \f{eqnarray*}
        &\frac{m_s^2}{2 g_s^2 M^2}, \frac{m_v^2}{2 g_v^2 M^2} 
        \frac{m_{\rho}^2}{8 g_{\rho}^2 M^2},\frac{b}{3},
        \frac{c}{4}
        &
        \nonumber \\
        &\frac{\zeta}{24}, \frac{\xi}{384},
        \frac{b_1}{4 g_{\omega}^2},
        \frac{b_2 M^2}{4 g_{\omega}^4},
        \frac{b_3 M^4}{4 g_{\omega}^6},
        \frac{a_1}{4 g_{\sigma} M},&
        \nonumber \\
        &\frac{a_2}{4 g_{\sigma}^2},
        \frac{a_3 M}{4 g_{\sigma}^3},
        \frac{a_4 M^2}{4 g_{\sigma}^4},
        \frac{a_5 M^3}{4 g_{\sigma}^5},~\mathrm{and}~\frac{a_6 M^4}
        {4 g_{\sigma}^6}\, .&
        \f}

        These values are stored in the variables cs, cw, cr, b, c,
        zeta, xi, b1, etc. in the specified \ref eos_had_rmf object. All
        of the numbers should be around 0.001 or 0.002.

        For the scale \f$ M \f$, \ref mnuc is used.

        \todo I may have ignored some signs in the above, which are
        unimportant for this application, but it would be good to fix
        them for posterity.
