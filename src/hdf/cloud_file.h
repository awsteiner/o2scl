  /** \brief Read a file and download from a URL if necessary
      
      \note This class requires POSIX I/O calls and a system call
      which uses <tt>mkdir -p</tt>, thus will probably only work on
      unix-like systems.

      \note This class uses system calls to <tt>curl</tt> or
      <tt>wget</tt> which must be installed separatley.

      \future Convert to use boost::filesystem?

      \future Automatically handle compressed files? This turns out to
      be complicated, because does the user specify the compressed
      hash, the decompressed hash, or both? I suppose it's best that
      the user specifies both, and you only download if you need to,
      or uncompress if you need to, but this will require nearly a
      full reworking of the get_file_hash function (or a completely
      new function). For the moment, compression has to be handled
      by the user. 

      \warning This class has several potential security issues 
      and should not be used without due care.
